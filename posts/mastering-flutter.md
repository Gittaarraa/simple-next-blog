Flutter powers the Multiplatform mobile app - it's **the important** programming language you need to know as a mobile developer.

For example, you should understand code like this:

```js
const basics = 'Okay, that should not be too difficult actually';

void printBasics() {
  print(basics):
}

printBasics();
```
